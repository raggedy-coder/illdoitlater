# Coding Guidelines
Primarily follows the rules set by [Swift.org](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)

## Homebrew Rules
- File names for extensions are prefixed by `+` (example: `+Date.swift`, `+Calendar.swift`)
- Use the `View` postfix for clarity (example: `NewTodoView` instead of `NewTodo`)
- In most cases, view components can just be written as is (example: `TodoListRow`, `TodoListTable`)
